# Cineplex Movie Complex
A Dotnet MVC application designed to emulate a cinema website with bookings and account creation.

## Reason for creation
This project was completed during my second year of university as a learning excerices to introduce students to DotNet and the MVC pattern.

## Tech used
- C#
- Visual Studio 2015/2017

## Definition of done
This project will be defined as completed when it:
- [x] Includes a basic number of navigational pages.
- [x] Provides a method for users view the currently showing movies.
- [x] Provides a method for users to book into a movie.
- [x] Handles faux payment without processing or validation.

### Stretch goals
There is also a stretch goal which I would like to implement.
- [x] Integration with the Google API for user accounts.

## Retrospective
- Setting up this project was tough, and I am still not certain of everything that I did. Dotnet core seems to have a bit of a learning curve.
- There are a lot of connecting components for set up before beginning to work on the website functionality itself.
- Even though we used dotnet to implement this, javascript was still used for some functionality. I expected to be able to achieve everything without javascript since it is a C# application.
